The code involves implementing a layered architecture with the Observer pattern, Pipe and Filter pattern, and specific domain requirements for university transport. Here's how the solution is structured:
1. Observer Pattern: Notify students when the driver leaves the university.
2. Layered Architecture: Divide the system into Presentation, Service, Business Logic, and Data Access layers.
3. Pipe and Filter: Apply filters to differentiate between student/faculty and payment status.
